# This file is used to create a user that can manage the deployment via github #
# actions. It doesn't need a whole lot of privs, but it needs access to the    #
# bucket where the shared resources will be replaced. This also creates the    #
# publicly accessible bucket and attaches a read only policy.                  #
#                                                                              #
# After the user was created, I created credentials using the AWS console and  #
# saved them as secrets in github so that the deploy action can be completed.  #
#                                                                              #
