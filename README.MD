# AWS GLUE STREAMING ETL EXAMPLE - Scala

This implementation is based on the solution described here: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-serverless-streaming-etl-with-aws-glue/

### TODO

Backfill cloudformation yaml to include all Glue and Kinesis resources

### Not Included

At this stage, setup for the IoT portion will not be covered. If I get this all cleaned up for the later portions of the pipeline, I'll at the very least add a markup tutorial for getting the SenseHat working.
